There are many different ways to make an MSA. I used MMseqs2. I have this set up to run on a dedicated machine that holds all the databases in memory, and therefore is very fast. I would reccomend consulting the MMseqs2 github and the ColabFold github. After getting MMseqs2 databases set up, the call to make it work looks something like:

/path/to/colabfold_search $INPUT_FASTA /path/to/databases/ $OUTPUT_DIR \
        --db1 /path/to/uniref30_2302_db \
	    --db3 /path/to/colabfold_envdb_202108_db \
	    --db-load-mode 2 \
        --mmseqs /path/to/executable/mmseqs
